My Project name is MedCare which is a website designed to provide health information, appointment scheduling, and medical resources to users. It aims to make healthcare accessible and convenient. I use HTML and CSS to make this website. You can use this code on VS-Code and only by the help of Live Server, you are able to see the output. It is only a single page application so you can contribute to make this website available at large scale for user ease-of-use.
